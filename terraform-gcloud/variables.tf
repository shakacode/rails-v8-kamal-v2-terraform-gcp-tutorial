# (main.tf). The variables are defined with a name, description, type, and default value.
# The default value is used when no value is provided when running Terraform commands.
# The variables are referenced in the main configuration file using the var.<variable_name>
# syntax. For example, var.project_id references the project_id variable defined in this file.

# project_id corresponds to your GCP project ID, (not the project name)

# ssh_user is the SSH username that will be used to access the instance.
# This is the username that you use to SSH into the instance. The default value is justin.
# You need to change this to whatever you will use to SSH into the instance.
